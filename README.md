# Regression Project: Estimating Home Value

# Zillow Data Science Team

## Project Overview

- This project will be working with the Zillow data and create a model to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those with a transaction during the "hot months" (in terms of real estate demand) of May-August, 2017.

- We would like to know what states and counties these are located in. We'd also like to know the distribution of tax rates for each county.

## Business Goals

- Predict the value of single unit properties duirng May - August, 2017
- Identify states and counties of the properties and the distribution of tax rates
- Presentation about findings to Zillow Data Science Team 

## Deliverables

1. A report in the form of a presentation, verbal supported by slides.

    - The report/presentation slides should summarize your findings about the drivers of the single unit property values. This will come from the analysis you do during the exploration phase of the pipeline. In the report, you should have visualizations that support your main points.

    - The presentation should be no longer than 5 minutes.

2.  A github repository containing your work. 'regression-project'

    - This repository should contain one clearly labeled final Jupyter Notebook that walks through the pipeline, but, if you wish, you may split your work among 2 notebooks, one for exploration and one for modeling. In exploration, you should perform your analysis including the use of at least two statistical tests along with visualizations documenting hypotheses and takeaways. In modeling, you should establish a baseline that you attempt to beat with various algorithms and/or hyperparameters. Evaluate your model by computing the metrics and comparing.

    - Make sure your notebook answers all the questions posed in the email from the Zillow data science team.

    - The repository should also contain the .py files necessary to reproduce your work, and your work must be reproducible by someone with their own env.py file.
